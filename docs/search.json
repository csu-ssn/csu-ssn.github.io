I strongly believe we should learn to use, and develop, cutting edge techniques while remaining rooted in a strong tradition of natural history."

He then spent 3 years working with the endangered New Mexico Meadow Jumping Mouse (Zapus luteus) in southern New Mexico.\nIn Tim Bean‚Äôs lab at Cal Poly, Gregory‚Äôs research is part of a larger project looking into range shifts and habitat suitability for California small mammal species. Specifically, he is investigating changes in the extent of species‚Äô range using the latest data from the Sentinel Site Network, and assessing range-wide habitat suitability for each species. In the future, Gregory is interested in exploring new ways to better understand the distribution of species in the environment."
